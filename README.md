>> MESSAGES >>

In this box we can prompt each other on our activity. This area is not a substitute for quality commits. If it can be explained in a commit (or many commits) then please use git.
Examples:
- repo should be refreshed
- quirks in a section of code
- alert for help with a problem in project

Below is a description of the project and its ongoing development. It would be a place for developer notes and quick task instructions, maybe some quick debugging. Anything further would be documented externally

Messages will be treated as alerts and deleted after the message has been received.
